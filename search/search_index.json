This folder should be already be present in an existing repository with a few examples. The sample programs are simple Linux shell scripts (identified by the <code>#!/bin/sh</code> so-called shebangs). The shebang determines the actual type of the script, some other examples of the shebangs include <code>#!/bin/bash</code> and <code>#!/usr/bin/env python3</code>.</p> <p>To ensure that the hooks are runnable, run <code>chmod +x &lt;script-name&gt;</code> in the directory.

This means that every developer working on a specific project may locally define their own scripts they want to run, matching their personal preferences. Still, there are two ways to share the local hooks with the team:</p> <ol> <li>Put the hooks into a separate folder. Simply create a normal folder for the hooks and treat the scripts just as regular repository files. Optionally, it is possible to create a Linux symlink to the <code>.git/hooks</code> directory (this means that the directory has 2 or more paths which it resides on, but in reality, the directory is stored just once). This means all of the files will be updated automatically.</li> <li>Use the Git template folder directory, which may be set up via the <code>$GIT_TEMPLATE_DIR</code> environment variable or via configuring Git. This will also update the hooks automatically.</li> </ol> <p>We will talk about the server hooks later.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"git_hooks/#local-hooks","title":"Local hooks","text":"<p>As already mentioned, the hooks can be modified by the contributor.
